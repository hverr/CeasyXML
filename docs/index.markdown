#What is CeasyXML?
CeaysXML is a library that allows you to automate the connection between your
XML documents and your objective-c classes.

#How do I use CeasyXML?
By using an XML document to define the layout of your own XML document, the
parser and writer know exactly how to handle your documents and how to 
use your classes.

`CSXXMLParser` and `CSXXMLWriter` are the primary classes you will be using.
These provide a direct interface to the library.

- See [How to define the layout of your XML document][1] to write your first
  document layout.
- See [Parsing XML documents][2] for a tutorial on how to parse your own XML
  documents.
- See [Writing XML documents][3] for a tutorial on how to write your own XML
  documents with your custom class.
