#How to define the layout of your XML document

Using an XML document you can define the layout of your own XML document. The
library will parse the layout document and setup the parser or writer with this
layout. So this library uses itself to parse your documents.

## Two types of layout documents
We have to types of layout documents. A type that specifies only one layout, and
a type that specifies multiple layouts.

### The layout document
The layout document is the document type that specifies one document layout. It
is the XML representation of the class `CSXDocumentLayout`.

The root element uses `layout` as tagname. With the attribute named `name` you
can specify the root element of your own XML document. The second attribute is
named `class`. With this attribute you specify the name of your class that
represents the whole document.

For example, if we have a root element like below, 

    <layout name="store" class="MyShop">

CeasyXML knows your document has a root element named `library`,

    <library>

and that this element's contents should be stored in an instance of you class
`MyLibrary`.

### The layout list document
This type of document contains several layouts. These layouts are all possible
layouts of one XML document. This type of document is represented by the class
`CSXLayoutList`.

The root element uses `document` as tagname. It has no attributes, but it must
have at least one subelement. This subelement must be a `layout` element as
defined above.

For example, if we have a document like below,

    <document>
        <layout name="store" class="MyShop">
            _content_
        </layout>

        <layout name="bank" class="MyBank">
            _content_
        </layout>
    </document>

CeasyXML knows your document may have a root element named `store` or `bank`. It
will parse your document using the according layout.

## Content of the 'layout' element.
Of course your root `layout` element contains subelements. It may even contain some
attributes. By using the non-unique `element` element and the non-unique
`attribute` element, you can specify these.

To let the library know wether these attributes represent a number, string,
boolean or even a custom class, we use the `content` element.

For example, if we have a root element like this,

    <layout name="store" class="MyStore">
        <attribute name="location">
            <content type="string">
                <getter>location</getter>
                <setter>setLocation:</setter>
            </content>
        </attribute>

        <element name="item">
            <content type="custom">
                <getter>items</getter>
                <setter>setItems:</setter>
                <class>MyItem</class>
            </content>
        </element>
    </layout>

the library knows to expect a document like this.

    <store location="Brussels">
        <item></item>
        <item></item>
        <item></item>
        etc.
    </store>

It also knows that your class `MyStore` has the methods `setLocation:` and
`location`, which respectively accept and return an `NSString`.

Besides these two methods, `MyStore` also has the two methods `setItems:`
and `items`, which respectively accept and return an `NSMutableArray`. The 
library pushes or pop instances of your class `MyItem` to this array.

Of course we can add new `element` and `attribute` elements
to the `<element name="item">` element to define new fields of this element, and
so on.

## Element reference for 'document'
### Attributes
None

### Subelements
- At least one `layout` element.

## Element reference for 'layout'
### Attributes
- `name` (required): Specifies the root element name of your document.
- `class` (required): Specifies the class that your document represents.

### Subelements
- `attribute` (non-unique): Specifes the attributes the root element can or must
  have.
- `element` (non-unique): Specifies the elements the root element can or must
  contain.

## Element reference for 'attribute'
### Attributes
- `name` (required): The name of the attribute in your XML document.

### Subelements
- `content` (required, unique): The content type and handling for this
  attribute's value.
- `required` (empty): Wether or not this attribute is required to be present in
  your document.

## Element reference for 'element'
### Attributes
- `name` (required): The name of the element in your XML document.

### Subelements
- `content` (required, unique): The content type and handling for this element's
  content.
- `requierd` (empty): Wether or not this element is required to be present in
  your document.
- `empty` (empty): Wether or not this is an empty element.
- `unique` (empty): Wether or not this element is unique.
- `attribute` (non-unique): The attributes this element can have.
- `element` (non-unique): The subelements this element can have. This can only
  be used when the content type is a custom class.

## Element reference for 'content'
### Attributes
- `type` (required): The content type. It must be one of the following values:
    - 'string', which represents an `NSString`.
    - 'number', which represents an `NSInteger`.
    - 'boolean', which represents a `BOOL`.
    - 'custom', which represents a custom user-defined class.

### Subelements
- `getter` (required, string): The name of the selector to get the value.
- `setter` (required, string): The name of the selector to set the value.
- `class` (string): The name of the user-defined, custom class. This 
  element must only be present when the type 'custom' is specified.
